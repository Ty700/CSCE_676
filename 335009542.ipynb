        "Onboard into the course (introductions and short video), perform end-to-end data analysis on a noisy real-world dataset (ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis), practice clear technical communication (written and spoken via short video), and answer interview-style questions that assess data reasoning, assumptions, tradeoffs, and limitations.\n",

        "***Submission instructions:***\n",
        "\n",
        "You should post your notebook to Canvas (look for the homework 1 assignment there). Please name your submission **your-uin_hw1.ipynb**, so for example, my submission would be something like **555001234_hw1.ipynb**. Your notebook should be fully executed when you submit ... so run all the cells for us so we can see the output, then submit that.\n",

        "1. **[A Code Cell] Your Code:** If code is not applicable, put `# no code` in the cell. For tests: tests can be simple assertions or checks (e.g., using `assert` or `print` or small functions or visual inspection); formal testing frameworks are not required.\n",
        "2. **[A Markdown Cell] Your Answer:** Write up your answers and explain them in complete sentences. Include any videos in this section as well; for videos, upload them to your TAMU Google Drive, and ensure they are set to be visible by the instruction team (`caverlee@tamu.edu` and `mariateleki@tamu.edu`), then share the link to the video in the cell.\n",
        "3. **[A Markdown Cell] Your Resources:** You need to cite 3 types of resources and note how they helped you: (1) Collaborators, (2) Web Sources (e.g. StackOverflow), and (3) AI Tools (you must also describe how you prompted, but we do not require any links to any specific chats). Specifically, use the following format as a template:\n",

        "3. AI Tools:\n",
        "- ChatGPT: I gave it the homework .ipynb file and the ufo.csv, and told it to generate the code for the first question, but it did it with csv.reader(), so I re-prompted it to use pandas and that one was correct\n",

        "\n",
        "2. We want you to pay attention to how you can successfully get help to move through problems! Is there someone you work with or an AI tool that helps you learn the material better? That's great! The point of engineering is to use your tools to solve hard problems, and part of graduate school is learning about how *you* learn and solve problems best.\n",

        "***A reminder: you get out of it what you put into it.***\n",
